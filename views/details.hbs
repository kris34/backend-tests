            <p>Hi friends! How was the weekend? I hope you had an amazing one. This blog post is a way to bring it back
                old school and share some more real-life adventures. Quite a few of you let me know that you missed the
                style of blogging from the past (I do, too!) so I'm trying to do it in a way that's low-key and still
                focused on my experience, instead of the kids' experience if that makes sense? It can be tricky because
                the kids are obviously a huge part of my life (and by far the most exciting and such an enjoyable part
                of my life). I'm still trying to navigate blogging in a way that feels authentic to me without overdoing
                it on kid content, while continuing to create value-driven posts, too.</p>
